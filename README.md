# Focus search fields without using the mouse
## Description

This extension grew out of my daily need to focus the search fields on several sites without using the mouse.

When we want to be productive, having to leave the keyboard to grab the mouse and click on a search field can waste our time.
Therefore, this extension allows you to focus the search field by **pressing the Esc key**.

Very useful on sites like Google, Wikipedia, Linguee, etc.
